<h1>Saving a Report</h1>
<p>
In addition to providing an interactive report FastQC also
has the option to create an HTML version of this report
for a more permanent record.  This HTML report can also
be generated directly by running FastQC in non-interactive
mode.
</p>
<p>
To create a report simply select File &gt Save Report from
the main menu.  By default a report will be created using
the name of the fastq file with _fastqc.zip appended to the
end.  The report will be created for whichever file tab
was active when the menu option was selected.
</p>
<p>
The report file which is created is actually a zip file.
When uncompressed this will create a folder with the same
name as the report file.  Inside this will be a series of
files, but the one to look at is the fastqc_report.html
file which links to the other files in the report.
